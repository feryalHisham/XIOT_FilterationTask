# XIOT_FilterationTask
#to assemble the ciruit we can use arduino Uno board and a temperature sensor:
connect the temperature sensor output pin to analog in pin 0 on arduino board and connect its ground and VCC pin to GND pin and 5V pin respectively.
In the code I used pin 13 to use Arduino board's LED, so we don't need any further components.

#Assumptions:
I assumed that printing "pressed" is done in case of any change in the switch, I was confused whether "pressed" means that the switch is toggled to force the LED ON or any toggle.

#Language and framework experience 
I used Arduino c. I worked with Arduino on a previous microcontroller project. It was a team project, we used Arduino as a microcontroller and stepper motors, IR sensor and LCD to make a basketball game.
